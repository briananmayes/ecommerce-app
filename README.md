# Ecommerce-project
## Overview
Hello! This project is the result of completing the following Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-angular-spring-boot-tutorial/

I took this course to practice both my Angular and Java coding skills as well as have a working full stack application. After completing the course, I chose to deploy the application on Heroku, which was a great learning experience. 

The technologies used while developing this application: Angular, Bootstrap, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Okta Oauth2 
Local development makes use of the MySQL JDBC driver and production makes use of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver for Heroku.

## Demo
The application can be viewed at the following link
